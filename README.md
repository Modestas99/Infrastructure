# Terraform Multi-Service Deployment

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision, manage, and maintain cloud resources efficiently. It includes multiple modules, each responsible for a specific component of the infrastructure.

### Features and Capabilities

1. **Resource Deployment**
   - Virtual Machines: Deploys virtual machines with customizable configurations.
   - Storage Accounts: Creates and configures storage accounts for data storage.
   - Virtual Networks: Provisions virtual networks with subnets for secure communication.
   - Key Vaults: Deploys and manages key vaults for secure storage of secrets.

2. **Modular Design**
   - Each component is organized into its own module (e.g., networking, virtual machines, storage) for reusability and scalability.

3. **Terraform Backend**
   - Configures backend settings for state management, ensuring consistent deployments across teams.

4. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Includes automated workflows for:
     - Code formatting checks (`terraform fmt`).
     - Linting (`tflint`) for detecting common configuration issues.
     - Security scanning (`tfsec`) to identify vulnerabilities in Terraform code.
     - Automated deployment of infrastructure when changes are merged to `main`.

5. **Example Configurations**
   - Provides example implementations for deploying various services, demonstrating best practices in infrastructure as code.

### Purpose

This repository is designed for:
- Serving as a starter template for deploying multi-service cloud environments.
- Automating infrastructure deployment and management using CI/CD.
